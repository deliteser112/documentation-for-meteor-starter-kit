## HTML in markdown

‚ö†Ô∏è HTML in markdown is quite unsafe, but if you want to support it, you can
use [rehype-raw](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-raw).
You should probably combine it with
[rehype-sanitize](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-sanitize).
~~~js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown'
import rehypeHighlight from 'rehype-highlight'

ReactDOM.render(
  <ReactMarkdown rehypePlugins={[rehypeHighlight]}>{'# Your markdown here'}</ReactMarkdown>,
  document.querySelector('#content')
)
~~~
`;

export default POST_BODY;
