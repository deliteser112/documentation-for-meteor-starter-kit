<h6>This guide is for a Meteor Starter Kit for building a production-ready product.</h6> 

Before you go any further, here are some big important things to know:

Make sure you agree with MST's technology stack (MST: Meteor Starter Kit)

* MST is built on top of the Meteor JavaScript platform (MST utilizes the simplicity of its build system and accounts implementation).
* MST uses GraphQL for its data. It ships with a fully implemented GraphQL server and schema with subscriptions support.
* MST uses MongoDB as its database but GraphQL allows you to use any data source.
* MST uses React for its UI library.
* MST uses Material UI(v5.8.0) for its CSS/SCSS framework and React MUI to get Material components in React.
* MST uses React Router v6 for its router.
* MST uses React Material UI framework for authoring CSS.
* MST includes server-side rendering (SSR) out of the box.

MST is designed for production use

<blockquote>
  üëâThe goal of MST is to give you a real-world foundation for your product. It's designed to be production ready from day one. The technology it uses is designed to be "scale friendly," though, scaling is up to you‚Äî ‚ö†Ô∏è that's impossible for MST to automate.

If all of this sounds good, you're ready to get started! Your first step is to clone MST and install its dependencies:
