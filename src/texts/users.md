One of the first—and arguably, more tedious—tasks any product owner will do after they ship their product is add some sort of user administration. Because running an active product requires an easy way to manage the users (or customers) who consume it, it makes sense for MST to offer this functionality to you out of the box.

Accessible via the /dashboard/users route for users with the admin role, the Users admin in MST is designed to help you manage the accounts of individual users. The why for this varies, but typically this sort of functionality is helpful from a customer support point of view.

In MST, you're given full access to manage each user's profile information—their first and last name, email address, and password—as well as their roles and settings (note: this excludes GDPR-related settings to avoid compliance issues).

By default, the current user is not included in the user administration list. Personal profiles should continue being managed via the <span class="badge">/profile</span> page.
